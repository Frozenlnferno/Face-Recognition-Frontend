This is a simple and functional app I built to learn full stack development. I made the frontend for a full-stack app that finds faces in pictures using image links. While working on this project, I learned a lot about both frontend and backend development. On the frontend, I used React to build components, manage state, and make API calls. On the backend, I learned how to create APIs, handle requests, and connect to a face detection service. This project helped me understand how the frontend and backend work together in a real app.
